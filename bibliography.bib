	abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The
detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  It was
conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a
centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at
luminosities up to 1034 cm−2 s−1 (1027 cm−2 s−1).  At the core of the CMS detector sits a
high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid
surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate
scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a
brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter.  The iron yoke of the
flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors
covering most of the 4π solid angle.  Forward sampling
calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values
(|η| ⩽ 5) assuring very good hermeticity.  The overall
dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of
14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.}
